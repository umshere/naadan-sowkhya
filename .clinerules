# Task Context Management Rules

**⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES ⚠️**

## Context Window Monitoring (MANDATORY)

You **MUST** monitor the context window usage displayed in environment details. When usage exceeds 50% of the available context window, you **MUST**:

1. Complete your current logical step
2. Use `ask_followup_question` to offer creating a new task
3. If approved, use the `new_task` tool with comprehensive handoff instructions

## Context Structure (REQUIRED)

When using the `new_task` tool, you **MUST** include:

### Mandatory Context Sections

```xml
<new_task>
<context>
# Task Continuation: [Brief Task Title]

## Completed Work
- [Detailed list of completed items]
- [Files modified/created]
- [Key decisions made]

## Current State
- [Project status]
- [Running processes]
- [Key file states]

## Next Steps
- [Remaining tasks]
- [Implementation details]
- [Known challenges]

## Reference Information
- [Documentation links]
- [Code snippets]
- [User preferences]

Please continue by [specific next action].
</context>
</new_task>
```

## Handoff Triggers (REQUIRED)

Initiate task handoffs when:

1. Context window usage exceeds 50%
2. Completing a major component/feature
3. Switching between different project areas
4. Before starting complex operations
5. When accumulating significant context

## Best Practices (MANDATORY)

1. **Context Preservation**

   - Include all relevant file paths
   - Document key decisions
   - Maintain consistent terminology

2. **Clear Next Actions**

   - Specify immediate next steps
   - Include any necessary setup instructions
   - Note any pending decisions

3. **Project Continuity**
   - Reference related files and components
   - Maintain implementation patterns
   - Track overall progress

## User Interaction (REQUIRED)

Before creating a new task:

1. Summarize completed work
2. Present clear next steps
3. Use `ask_followup_question` for approval
4. Package context according to template above
5. Ensure smooth transition to new task
