# Gallery Page Analysis & Recommendations

**Cross-reference:** See the [Architecture Doc](../architecture.md) and [Style Guide](../style-guide.md) for overall project standards.

---

## 1. Current Structure

- **Main Route:** `/gallery`
- **Components:**
  - Gallery grid or carousel of images
  - Lightbox/modal for image viewing (if present)
  - Captions, categories, or filters (if present)
- **Styling:**
  - Mix of Tailwind CSS, custom classes, and possible shadcn/ui
  - May use backgrounds, overlays, or transitions

## 2. Branding & UI/UX Assessment

- **Strengths:**
  - Visually engaging, showcases brand imagery
  - Opportunity for interactive and immersive experience
- **Gaps:**
  - Inconsistent image sizes, spacing, or aspect ratios
  - Mixed component styles or navigation patterns
  - Lack of unified brand overlays, captions, or CTAs
  - Accessibility for images (alt text, keyboard navigation) may be lacking

## 3. Suggestions & Action Items

- Refactor gallery and all components to use only Tailwind CSS and the [Style Guide](../style-guide.md)
- Standardize image sizes, spacing, and overlays for a cohesive brand look
- Use branded captions, CTAs, and transitions
- Add or enhance accessibility (alt text, keyboard navigation, focus states)
- Optimize images for fast loading on mobile
- Test on all device sizes for mobile-first experience

**Next Steps:**
- Begin refactor, documenting before/after for each section
- Cross-reference this doc in the main [architecture.md](../architecture.md)
