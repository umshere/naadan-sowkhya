# Products Page Analysis & Recommendations

**Cross-reference:** See the [Architecture Doc](../architecture.md) and [Style Guide](../style-guide.md) for overall project standards.

---

## 1. Current Structure

- **Main Route:** `/products`
- **Dynamic Routes:** `/products/[slug]`, `/our_products/[product]`, `/product_category/[category]`
- **Components:**
  - Product list/grid
  - Product card components
  - Product detail view (for dynamic routes)
  - Filters, sorting, or categories (if present)
  - CTAs (add to cart, view details, etc.)
- **Styling:**
  - Mix of Tailwind CSS, custom classes, and possible shadcn/ui
  - May use backgrounds, badges, or overlays

## 2. Branding & UI/UX Assessment

- **Strengths:**
  - Clear product presentation and navigation
  - Dynamic routes support deep linking and SEO
  - Opportunity for strong brand visuals and storytelling
- **Gaps:**
  - Inconsistent card/component styling, spacing, or CTAs
  - Mixed use of Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and custom styles
  - Product detail layouts may lack brand cohesion
  - Accessibility for product info and images may be lacking

## 3. Suggestions & Action Items

- Refactor all product-related components to use only Tailwind CSS and the [Style Guide](../style-guide.md)
- Standardize product card layout, spacing, and CTAs for brand consistency
- Use branded badges, overlays, and imagery
- Enhance product detail pages with storytelling, specs, and clear CTAs
- Add or improve accessibility (alt text, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles)
- Test all product pages on multiple device sizes

**Next Steps:**
- Begin refactor, documenting before/after for each section
- Cross-reference this doc in the main [architecture.md](../architecture.md)
