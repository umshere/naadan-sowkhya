## 1. Current Structure

- **Sections:**
  - Hero (slider/banner)
  - Product Guarantee
  - About
  - Product Categories
  - Featured Products
  - Testimonials
  - Gallery
  - Certifications
- **Navigation:**
  - StickyNav (mobile/desktop)
  - HomePageTabs (mobile)
- **Layout:**
  - Uses SectionWrapper for spacing/background
  - Mobile and desktop layouts are split, with some duplicated logic
- **Styling:**
  - Mix of Tailwind CSS, custom classes, and possible shadcn/ui
  - Dynamic imports for some UI features

## 2. Branding & UI/UX Assessment

- **Strengths:**
  - Good use of visual sections and backgrounds
  - Mobile navigation and tab-based layout present
  - Engaging hero/banner and testimonials
- **Gaps:**
  - Inconsistent color, spacing, and typography across sections
  - Brand identity not fully unified (mixed component styles)
  - Navigation and CTAs differ between mobile/desktop
  - Not all components use the style guide or brand assets
  - Some sections lack clear storytelling or CTAs

## 3. Suggestions & Action Items

- Unify layout using responsive Tailwind classes; remove code duplication
- Refactor all components to use only Tailwind CSS and follow the [Style Guide](../style-guide.md)
- Standardize CTAs, buttons, and navigation for a cohesive brand feel
- Optimize images and backgrounds for mobile performance
- Ensure all sections reinforce the brandâ€™s story and visual identity
- Improve accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA roles
- Test all changes on multiple device sizes

**Next Steps:**
- Begin section-by-section refactor, referencing this document and the style guide for each update.
- Document before/after for each major section as changes are made.
