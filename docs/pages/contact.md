# Contact Page Analysis & Recommendations

**Cross-reference:** See the [Architecture Doc](../architecture.md) and [Style Guide](../style-guide.md) for overall project standards.

---

## 1. Current Structure

- **Main Route:** `/contact`
- **Components:**
  - Contact form (fields for name, email, message, etc.)
  - Company contact info (address, phone, email)
  - Map or location embed (if present)
  - Social links or secondary CTAs
- **Styling:**
  - Mix of Tailwind CSS, custom classes, and possible shadcn/ui
  - May use custom backgrounds or images

## 2. Branding & UI/UX Assessment

- **Strengths:**
  - Clear entry point for user communication
  - Opportunity to reinforce brand trust and accessibility
- **Gaps:**
  - Inconsistent styling or input appearance
  - Form validation and feedback may be unclear or unbranded
  - Brand voice and visuals may not be fully unified
  - CTAs or secondary actions may lack consistency

## 3. Suggestions & Action Items

- Refactor form and all components to use only Tailwind CSS and the [Style Guide](../style-guide.md)
- Standardize input fields, buttons, and feedback messages for brand consistency
- Use clear, branded CTAs ("Send Message", "Call Us", etc.)
- Add or enhance accessibility (labels, ARIA, error messages)
- Ensure all contact info is up to date and easy to find
- Test on all device sizes for mobile-first experience

**Next Steps:**
- Begin refactor, documenting before/after for each section
- Cross-reference this doc in the main [architecture.md](../architecture.md)
