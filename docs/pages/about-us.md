## 3. Suggestions & Action Items

- Refactor About Us and subpages to use only Tailwind CSS and follow the [Style Guide](../style-guide.md)
- Standardize typography, spacing, and colors for a cohesive brand feel
- Use high-quality images and backgrounds that reinforce brand identity
- Add or enhance sections for mission, vision, team, and history if missing
- Ensure clear CTAs (e.g., Contact, Join Us, Learn More)
